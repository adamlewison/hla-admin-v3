- Responsive design for desktop and tablet use
- Fast loading with optimized images

## Architecture & Organization

### Component Structure

```
/components
  /ui           # Reusable UI components
  /forms        # Form components
  /layout       # Layout components
  /tables       # Data display components
  /modals       # Modal components
```

### Page Structure

```
/app
  /dashboard    # Main dashboard pages
  /api          # API routes
  /auth         # Authentication pages
