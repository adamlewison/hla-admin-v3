I want to create an admin dashboard for managing the hla website.
The dashboard must be able to control the following things (only these features for now):

- projects - add / edit / delete / add project_images / delete project_images /
- project_images - add / edit / delete
- clients - add / edit / delete / add project / remove project
- project_categories - add / edit / delete

I want to use nextjs (without typescript). I want the code to be modular (broken up into reusable components).

I am using a supabase database and supabase storage for the images.

Use the nextjs project in the current directory.
